# Sprint

This file contains reviews of all the sprints conducted throught the project. Sprints are based on
sprints used in the Scrum process. Sprints in our project usually lasts one week.

## Week 1

We were unable to complete the milestone for this sprint due to deprioritizing of the project. We
think we underestimated the technicalities with the making the protocol. We will continue to work
on this in the next sprint and throughout the project, since we assume it will be updated
consistently.

The only thing we think we could improve, is the amount of time and effort put into the project.
But this should not be a problem, now that we are able to prioritize it.

## Week 2

The progress didn't go quite as planned. The main problem is that we are struggling to get the hang of the project.
We have worked the planned hours, but the project is progressing slowly or barely at all.

Going forward, further understanding and staring to see progress is the main objective of the next sprint. We need
small and meaningful progression to stay motivated.

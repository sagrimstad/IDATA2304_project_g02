# Sprint

This file contains reviews of all the sprints conducted throught the project. Sprints are based on
sprints used in the Scrum process. Sprints in our project usually lasts one week.

## Week 1 / Sprint 1

We were unable to complete the milestone for this sprint due to deprioritizing of the project. We
think we underestimated the technicalities with the making the protocol. We will continue to work
on this in the next sprint and throughout the project, since we assume it will be updated
consistently.

The only thing we think we could improve, is the amount of time and effort put into the project.
But this should not be a problem, now that we are able to prioritize it.

## Week 2 / Sprint 2

The progress didn't go quite as planned. The main problem is that we are struggling to get the hang 
of the project. We have worked the planned hours, but the project is progressing 
slowly or barely at all.

Going forward, further understanding and staring to see progress is the main objective of the 
next sprint. We need small and meaningful progression to stay motivated.


## Sprint 3

This sprint did not go as planned either. We were still struggling with the same problems and 
progress was slow or at times backwards. The main issue was that we couldn't decide on which 
approach we should go with. We were slowly working on 2 branches simultaneously, and we went back
and forth on which approach to go for. In the end we made a decision. 

The sprint also went a little bit over due. A breakthrough happened at the end of this sprint, 
which left the good hopeful going forward.
